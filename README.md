# Computational-Musicology
Way more than 250 words, I am aware, but thought I'd get my thoughts on paper and feedback could help me determine what is important :)

My corpus consists of a playlist containing 80's new wave/ new romantic songs and a playlist containing trance classics from the early 90's to the mid 2010's. I was inspired by a statement made by BBC Radio 2, referring to Blue Monday (New Order's 1983 hit), as "a crucial link between Seventies disco and the dance/house boom that took off at the end of the Eighties." The repetative use of synths and heavy drum beats is a known characteristic of both new wave and trance music, and lead me to compare the two and see if any links could indeed be found.

A heavy thumping beat alternating with a high-hat is present in both genres, and so I expect to find simularities in the percussion patterns used. Trance genrally ranges from 135-150 BPM, I expect to see a broader range in the 80's playlist with a lower lower bound as the music in the 80's tends to be slower. 
Another important simularity I expect to be present is the heavy use of synths, though I think there are some obvious differences when it comes to the tones of these synths. The 'punchy' synth sounds from the 80's have turned more towards more complex chord progressions of sweeping strings in trance music. I believe this difference will also be apparent in the valence and keys of the compared genres, with the dark and slightly eerie influences of the new-romantic style and the socially critical new-wave style compared to the euphoric feeling of trance music, with elements remeniscent of the more spiritual new age style. 
Interestingly, the number of female voices in the trance songs is significantly larger than the number of male voices, a divide much less apparent in the 80's genres. Moreover, the number of instrumental tracks is notably larger in the trance playlist.
I am curious to see the difference in the 'energy' measured by spotify, as I believe both genres contain a high amount of energy, but the energy they contain is different, as described above.

Typical examples of interesting tracks from the 80's playlist would be Blue Monday - New Order and Fade To Grey - Visage. 
Both tracks contain a basic chord progression in a minor key played on a synthesizer repeated throughout the song, accompanied by a similar drum and high hat beat.
Typical examples of interesting tracks from the trance playlist would be Adagio for Strings - TiÃ«sto and Carte Blanche - Veracocha. Both songs contain well known riffs and are comprised of a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 "peaks" or "drops". Both songs are also in minor keys, a common characteristic of trance music.
